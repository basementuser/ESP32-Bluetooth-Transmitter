# ESP32-Bluetooth-Transmitter
This repo contains code that will enable your ESP32-A1S module to act as a Bluetooth Transmitter to play music.


This sketch requires these libraries to run: https://github.com/vanbwodonk/es8388arduino.git, https://github.com/pschatzmann/ESP32-A2DP.git
This section assumes you can build for the ESP32 in Arduino. If you can't, follow this guide: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/. Be sure you use the newest version of the ESP32 board package. This project will be using an ESP32-A1S Audio Dev Kit board, be sure to set your board type to "ESP32-WROOM-DA Module" in Arduino IDE.
